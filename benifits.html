						For both the seller and the customer, online payments 
						save a lot of time. People don�t have to wait in lines, 
						take time to write checks, or wait for paper bills. They 
						don�t have to wait for banks to clear their checks so 
						that they can access the money.<br>
						<br>
						For sellers, it saves a great deal of time since they 
						don�t have to waste time printing and mailing bills. 
						Online payments also decrease the chances of late 
						payments. Since it takes less than a few minutes to 
						complete a transaction, people will not forget it or put 
						it off for later.</font></td>

						People can pay for goods and services at any time of the

						feature on your smartphone than to collect the correct 
						amount of cash for your purchase. You don�t have to 
						carry a lot of cash, get worried about theft or not 
						having perfect change. With online payment options, you

						One of the biggest advantages of having online payment 
						gateways is that businesses can operate globally and 
						have a customer base irrespective of geographical 
						limitations. According to research, over 56% of online 
						shoppers prefer to shop cross-border. So implementing

						In a traditional payment setup, businesses have to hire

						online payment gateways with minimal investment and

						payment gateways for your business. However, before you 
						choose the services of a particular vendor, you can
