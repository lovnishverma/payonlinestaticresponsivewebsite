            <h1>RBI Guidelines for Various Online Transactions</h1>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
               Under the latest RBI guidelines, only card issuers and card networks are authorized to store customers' card details. Merchants and payment aggregators must delete stored card information from their systems due to previous security compromises.

Starting January 1, 2024, merchants are required to adopt "Tokenisation" for transactions. This method replaces sensitive card details with a unique code, or "token," to enhance security. Tokenisation ensures that transactions can be completed without sharing the cardholder’s actual details with merchants or intermediaries. Notably, UPI transactions already utilize tokenisation for added safety.

The RBI’s new rules on recurring payments, effective from October, mandate a one-time additional factor authentication for auto-debit transactions using debit or credit cards, or UPI. Recurring payments over ₹5,000 will require OTP-based authentication for each transaction to proceed.

Consumers are now given the option to have their card details tokenised for future online purchases. While not mandatory, tokenisation offers a seamless one-click checkout process. If customers choose not to tokenise, they will need to manually enter their card number, CVV, and expiry date for every transaction.

These measures are designed to safeguard consumers' financial data and ensure secure online transactions in India’s rapidly evolving digital payment ecosystem.
